From our group's interpretation of the project spec, we are making several 
assumptions about the users, the limit of information inputted into the program,
assumptions about the requirements of Dreams itself and the functions we are 
testing in this iteration.

We are assuming:
-users can creat a channel only after they log in.
-one user can create multiple channels, and they're members and owners of that channel.
